Cloned Google's homepage using my limited html and css knowledge.

Learned the following:
    -How to create a simple webpage using only html and css.
    -Moved elements around: centered and moved them to the bottom.
    -Located and used url images. 
    -Created a css style document and applied the styles into my html document.

Reflection: While the project was small in scope, it allowed me to improve my css and html skills and understand the workflow that is involved in creating a webpage.
